  Doug Henschen is Vice President and Principal Analyst focusing on data-driven


  decision making. Henschenâ€™s Data-to-Decisions research examines how organizations


  employ data analysis to reimagine their business models and gain a deeper


  understanding of their customers. Henschen's research acknowledges the fact that


  innovative applications of data analysis requires a multi-disciplinary approach starting


  with information and orchestration technologies, continuing through business


  intelligence, data-visualization, and analytics, and moving into NoSQL and big-data


  analysis, third-party data enrichment, and decision-management technologies.




  Insight-driven business models are of interest to the entire C-suite, but most particularly


  chief executive officers, chief digital officers, chief financial officers, chief marketing


  officers, chief information officers, chief customer officers, and manufacturing and


  supply chain leaders.
